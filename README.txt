# Python-Image-Displayer

This program will only work in MacOS.

It also assumes that your default image viewer is Preview, however you can change this by going to line 47 and replacing 'Preview' in 'pkill Preview' with the program name

tkinter and Pillow are also required, you can get Pillow at https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/
